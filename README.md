# EmployeeManagementSystem

## Description

Motivation for this project to understand how to properly use schema / sql!
I built this project to I would be able to save data that user inputted within a terminal and translate it into a table on mySQL which could be viewed.
The problem that this project solves is having to go through extra clicks just to do a few tasks in managing an group of employees within a system!
I learned how to connect with js to sql and how to connect sql to a connection that allows me to test it!
